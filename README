GREED

This was made as the "extra credit" to the Ruby Koans (http://rubykoans.com/), a wonderful TDD tutorial to teach yourself Ruby.

It is my first attempt at coding in Ruby. As such, it certainly lacks elegance, clarity and is probably not written in "fluent" Ruby.
All advice is welcome.

This is a multi-player, "pass-the-keyboard", dice game. Launch a game with:
    $ ruby src/greed.rb

[Read the rules here.](src/GREED_RULES.txt)

If you are so inclined, you can run the tests by going to the src/ directory:
    $ cd src
    $ ruby test.rb
